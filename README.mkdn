This is my résumé, built using Rob Oakes' excellent
[xetexCV class](http://www.oak-tree.us/blog/index.php/2009/11/25/latex-cv-part1)
for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) using
[LyX](http://www.lyx.org/), along with a series of examples of my work
that are linked to from the résumé itself. I use the
[doit](http://pydoit.org/) build tool to build my résumé and
supporting files and deploy them to my web server.

To see what the result looks like, you can view my résumé here:

If you want to use this as a template for your own résumé, you'll need
to install a few fonts (or else switch to fonts that you have/prefer):

1. Minion Pro: https://typekit.com/fonts/minion-pro
2. Fontin: http://www.exljbris.com/fontin.html
3. Fontin Sans: http://www.exljbris.com/fontinsans.html

Additionally, my résumé uses slightly modified versions of the xetexCV
document class ([`xetexCV.cls`](./xetexCV.cls)) and LyX layout
([`xetexCV.layout`](./xetexCV.layout)), which are included in this
repository. You may need to install these files to the appropriate
locations for LaTeX and LyX, respectively in order for the resume pdf
to build properly.
