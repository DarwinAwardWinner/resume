This is my résumé, built using Rob Oakes' excellent
[xetexCV class](http://www.oak-tree.us/blog/index.php/2009/11/25/latex-cv-part1)
for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) using 
[LyX](http://www.lyx.org/), along with a series of examples of
my work that are linked to from the résumé itself. I use
the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) build
tool to automate generating the PDF of my résumé, preparing all the
supporting files, and deploying them all to a web server for online
viewing. You can see the result here:

There is also an HTML version generated from the same source here:
http://darwinawardwinner.github.io/resume/ryan_thompson_resume.html

Lastly, there is a manually-prepared plain text version here:

If you want to use this as a template for your own résumé, you'll need
to install a few fonts (or else switch the style to fonts that you
prefer):

1. Minion Pro: https://typekit.com/fonts/minion-pro
2. Fontin: http://www.exljbris.com/fontin.html
3. Fontin Sans: http://www.exljbris.com/fontinsans.html

Additionally, my résumé uses slightly modified versions of the xetexCV
document class ([`xetexCV.cls`](./xetexCV.cls)) and LyX layout
([`xetexCV.layout`](./xetexCV.layout)), which are included in this
repository. You may need to install these files to the appropriate
locations for LaTeX and LyX, respectively in order for the resume pdf
to build properly.
