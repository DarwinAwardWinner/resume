This is my résumé, built using Rob Oakes'
[xetexCV class](http://www.oak-tree.us/blog/index.php/2009/11/25/latex-cv-part1)
for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) using
[LyX](http://www.lyx.org/), along with a series of examples of my work
that are linked to from the résumé itself. I use the
[doit](http://pydoit.org/) build tool to build and deploy my résumé
and supporting files to my web server.
