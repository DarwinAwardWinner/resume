Research Experience
==========

Salomon & Su Labs, The Scripps Research Institute
----------
La Jolla, CA; 2012—2019
 
Contact: Dr. Andrew Su, asu@scripps.edu

* Created an open source, reproducible workflow to analyze a large
  multi-omics next-gen sequencing dataset of 220 RNA-seq and ChIP-seq
  samples to reveal coordinated changes in histone marks and gene
  expression during CD4 + T-cell activation as well as epigenetic
  convergence between naive and memory cells after activation [1,3,8].
* Significantly improved cross-validated performance of machine
  learning classifier for identifying biomarkers of transplant
  rejection by developing appropriate single-sample microarray
  normalization procedures [5], including training a custom set of
  frozen RMA normalization vectors. Classifier is currently being
  developed into a clinical test for transplant dysfunction.
* Performed a comprehensive comparative evaluation of over 20 subtly
  different statistical models for differential methylation in
  Illumina 450k arrays, selecting a model that best explained the
  observed sources and trends of variation in the data, including
  cross-domain application of a method originally designed for RNA-seq
  data.
* Evaluated and optimized cost and performance of custom protocol for
  RNA-seq of human and primate blood samples while minimizing nuisance
  globin reads. Increased yield of useful reads nearly 2-fold [7].
* Investigated effects of life-span-extending drug on worm gene
  expression over time revealing that the drug retards age-related
  “transcriptional drift”, preserving a youthful phenotype at the
  molecular level [4].
* Implemented a systems biology tool to analyze and efficiently
  present and summarize differential expression for multiple gene set
  & pathway methods run on multiple pathway databases, as well as
  differential expression of individual genes within each pathway.
* Performed comparative analysis of multiple differential expression
  statistical models to define best practice for optimal sensitivity
  while maintaining false positive control. Presented on theoretical
  and practical similarities and differences between methods.
* Taught basic RNA-seq theory and practical analysis for the
  graduate-level introductory bioinformatics course.
* Adapted common normalization methods from RNA-seq to improve
  performance in analysis of RASL-seq experiments [10].
* Active member of the Bioconductor community since 2012 and
  contributing developer for several Bioconductor packages.
* Mentored 3 coworkers from both biology and programming backgrounds
  in learning bioinformatics.

Summer Internship, Informatics IT, Merck & Co.
----------
Boston, MA; 2011

Contact: Adnan Derti, adnan.derti@gmail.com

* Built a transcriptome assembly and quantification pipeline using
  Cufflinks, including fully-automated cluster job control for
  high-throughput reproducible analysis, and presented a conceptual
  overview of Cufflinks' assembly and quantification algorithms to
  help the team understand Cufflinks.
* Assisted in a molecular genetics study to evaluate peformance of two
  variant calling algorithms in detection of causal mutations in
  antibiotic-resistant bacterial genomes.

Gaasterland Lab, UCSD Bioinformatcs
----------
La Jolla, CA; 2010 - 2012

Contact: Terry Gaasterland, gaasterland@ucsd.edu

* Designed and implemented Deloxer, a critical software step in a new
  Illumina mate-pair sequencing protocol using Cre recombination.
  Deloxer is published [6] and now in use in several labs around the
  world.
* Performed a molecular genetics study to find potential causal
  mutations for fatal iron overload disease in critically endangered
  black rhinoceros by de novo assembly of transcriptomes for black
  rhino and closely-related white rhino. Developed a custom pipeline
  to match up ortholog gene pairs, discover single-nucleotide
  differences between them, and functionally annotate these
  differences, and delivered a list of potential causal variants to
  collaborators for follow-up.
* Helped design & implement a large-scale high-throughput exome
  sequencing pipeline for SNP discovery and functional annotation,
  including QC and validation of on-target coverage depth and
  reproducibility of coverage.
* Created a fully-automated pipeline to produce quality-control
  metrics and plots for Illumina high-throughput sequencing data for
  early identification of failed runs or samples.
* Investigated the binding motif specificity of ZASC1 transcription
  factor in mouse T-cells using Affymetrix expression microarrays in
  ZASC1 siRNA knockdown experiment.
* Analyzed miRNA target predictions using GO & KEGG grouping to
  identify target pathways of autophagy-related miRNAs for biological
  validation.

Timko Lab, U. of Virginia Biology
----------
Charlottesville, VA; 2007—2009

Advisor: Paul J. Rushton

* Undergraduate thesis: Designed and implemented Contig Farmer, an
  algorithm for efficient selective contig assembly starting from
  “seed” sequences of interest, and used Contig Farmer to accelerate
  transcription factor gene discovery in cowpea and tobacco shotgun
  genomic sequence data [11].
* Investigated transcription factors mediating plant stress response
  using expression microarray time-course, and refined the custom
  microarray design using data from previous runs to identify and
  eliminate uninformative probes, yielding an improved design for
  future studies.
* Acted as interpreter to explain complex biological concepts to
  programmers and explain complex computational problems to
  biologists.
