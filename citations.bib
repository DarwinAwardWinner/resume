	Abstract = {Of all the systems of thinking that have made their way through the ages, Euclidean geometry remains one of the most appealing and intuitive. It is also one of the most successful, having been practiced continuously from Greek antiquity through modern-day schools. We will examine the aspects of geometry that account for this intuitiveness, as well as several innovations that allowed it to tackle new and more difficult problems. We begin with an analysis of Euclid's Elements, and then we will consider the contributions of two ancient authors, Archimedes and Apollonius. Lastly, we will see how two authors during the scientific revolution, Galileo Galilei and Ren{\'e} Descartes, pushed geometry into new areas, namely the realistic and the algebraic.},

	Abstract = {Here we present Contig Farmer, a tool for improving the length and depth of coverage of contigs generated from a database of short sequence reads. Contig Farmer works without assembling the entire database and has only modest hardware requirements. The underlying methodology of Contig Farmer is itera- tive growth of seed contigs using repeated search and assembly. The utility of Contig Farmer is demon- strated on the sequences in TOBFAC, the database of tobacco transcription factors. Contig Farmer suc- cessfully grew the TOBFAC contigs, both in length and in depth of coverage, to yield a larger, higher- quality set of contigs.},
