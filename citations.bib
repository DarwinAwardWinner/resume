@article{Scott036061,
	Abstract = {RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing, Selection, and Ligation (RASL-seq) is a method to measure the expression of hundreds of genes in thousands of samples for a fraction of the cost of competing methods. However, enzymatic inefficiencies of the original protocol and the lack of open source software to design and analyze RASL-seq experiments have limited its widespread adoption. We recently reported an Rnl2-based RASL-seq protocol (RRASL-seq) that offers improved ligation efficiency and a probe decoy strategy to optimize sequencing usage. Here, we describe an open source software package, RASLseqTools, that provides computational methods to design and analyze RASL-seq experiments. Furthermore, using data from a large RRASL-seq experiment, we demonstrate how normalization methods can be used for characterizing and correcting experimental, sequencing, and alignment error. We provide evidence that the three principal predictors of RRASL-seq reproducibility are barcode/probe sequence dissimilarity, sequencing read depth, and normalization strategy. Using dozens of technical and biological replicates across multiple 384-well plates, we find simple normalization strategies yield similar results to more statistically complex methods.},

@article{Rangarajue08833,
	Abstract = {Longevity mechanisms increase lifespan by counteracting the effects of aging. However, whether longevity mechanisms counteract the effects of aging continually throughout life, or whether they act during specific periods of life, preventing changes that precede mortality is unclear. Here, we uncover transcriptional drift, a phenomenon that describes how aging causes genes within functional groups to change expression in opposing directions. These changes cause a transcriptome-wide loss in mRNA stoichiometry and loss of co-expression patterns in aging animals, as compared to young adults. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we show that extending lifespan by inhibiting serotonergic signals by the antidepressant mianserin attenuates transcriptional drift, allowing the preservation of a younger transcriptome into an older age. Our data are consistent with a model in which inhibition of serotonergic signals slows age-dependent physiological decline and the associated rise in mortality levels exclusively in young adults, thereby postponing the onset of major mortality.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08833.001},

@unpublished{mathpaper,
	Abstract = {Of all the systems of thinking that have made their way through the ages, Euclidean geometry remains one of the most appealing and intuitive. It is also one of the most successful, having been practiced continuously from Greek antiquity through modern-day schools. We will examine the aspects of geometry that account for this intuitiveness, as well as several innovations that allowed it to tackle new and more difficult problems. We begin with an analysis of Euclid's Elements, and then we will consider the contributions of two ancient authors, Archimedes and Apollonius. Lastly, we will see how two authors during the scientific revolution, Galileo Galilei and Ren{\'e} Descartes, pushed geometry into new areas, namely the realistic and the algebraic.},

	Abstract = {Here we present Contig Farmer, a tool for improving the length and depth of coverage of contigs generated from a database of short sequence reads. Contig Farmer works without assembling the entire database and has only modest hardware requirements. The underlying methodology of Contig Farmer is itera- tive growth of seed contigs using repeated search and assembly. The utility of Contig Farmer is demon- strated on the sequences in TOBFAC, the database of tobacco transcription factors. Contig Farmer suc- cessfully grew the TOBFAC contigs, both in length and in depth of coverage, to yield a larger, higher- quality set of contigs.},
